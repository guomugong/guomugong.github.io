Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly, a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science education.
The course is for introductory course in operating systems at the third-year undergraduate level.
The course provides a clear description about the basic concepts that underlie operating systems (process, CPU schedule, file system, IO devices, etc).

Recommended Texts:
- *Operating Systems Concepts*, by ABRAHAM SILBERSCHATZ, PETER BAER GALVIN, GREG GAGNE, Tenth Edition.
- *Modern Operating Systems*, by ANDREW S. TANENBAUM, HERBERT BOS, Fourth Edition.

The course covers advanced algorithm design strategies and analysis using formal and mathematical techniques. Topics include asymptotic analyses of complexity bounds using big-O, little-o, omega, and theta notations. The algorithmic strategies (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, heuristics, and space-and-time tradeoffs) are covered.

Recommended Texts:
- *Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms*, by Anany Levitin, Third Edition.
- *Introduction to Algorithms*, by Cormen, Leiserson, et al.
- *The Art of Computer Programming*, by Donald E. Knuth, Third Edition.
