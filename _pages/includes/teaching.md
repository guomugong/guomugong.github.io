The course covers advanced algorithm design strategies and analysis using formal and mathematical techniques. Topics include asymptotic analyses of complexity bounds using big-O, little-o, omega, and theta notations. The algorithmic strategies (brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, recursive backtracking, dynamic programming, branch-and-bound, heuristics, and space-and-time tradeoffs) are covered.

Recommended Texts:
