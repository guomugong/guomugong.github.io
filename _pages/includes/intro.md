I work at Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology (college of information and control engineering) as a research associate professor, leading the medical image analysis team and doing some interesting research. If interested, feel free to email me at [guosong@xauat.edu.cn](mailto:guosong@xauat.edu.cn).

I received my PhD degree in computer science and technology from Nankai University in 2020, under the supervision of prof. [Tao Li (李涛)](https://ics.nankai.edu.cn). Before that, I got my BS and MS in 2014 and 2017 in China Three Gorges University and Dalian University, respectively.
My research interest includes medical image analysis and computer vision.  I have published more than 20 papers with over 400+ google scholar citations.

如有意获得2023年9月份入学的硕士研究生资格，欢迎通过邮件与我联系并提供个人简历等信息!
